# **Django In A Nutshell**

## **What Is Django:**
Django is a high-level python web framework which encourages rapid development with clean and pragmatic
design. Its main motto says it all: "The Web Framework For The Perfectionists With Deadlines". Django follows
the MVT(model-view-template) architectural pattern. Like it is said on the [Django website](https://www.djangoproject.com/) :
Ridiculously fast.

    Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
Reassuringly secure.

    Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes.
Exceedingly scalable.

    Some of the busiest sites on the Web leverage Djangoâ€™s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.
